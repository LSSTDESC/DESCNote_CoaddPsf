This directory contains scripts that were used to create the figures, along with the figures themselves:

Figure 1 is produced using `psf_tests_inverse_variance.py`, and the resulting figure is written to `coadd_psf.png`.

Figure 2 is produced using `psf_tests_median.py`, and the resulting figure is written to `noisy_median_coadd_psf.png`.

Figure 3 is produced using `extended.py`, and the resulting figure is written to `extended.pdf`.


The calculations in Sec 3.2, leading up to Eq. 18 (TBC) were numerically confirmed with this notebook:
